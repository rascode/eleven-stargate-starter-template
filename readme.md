# Stargate 11 - 11ty Starter Template

Thinking about starting a new 11ty project? We have just the thing for you.  Introducing the Stargate 11 : 11ty Starter template.  With a semi-opinioned approach, this template comes stocked with:
 
 [x] PWA friendly Manifest.json scaffold file
 [x] Robots.txt
 [x] Site-wide configuration using the 11ty Data Cascade
 [x] Custom <code>eleventy.config.js</code> configuration with revised mapping for the data, layout, template and distribution directories
 [x] Use of most up-to-date eleventy release 3.0
 [ ] Image support using the 11ty image plugin (coming soon)
 [ ] Favicons that can replaced with your own (coming soon)
 [ ] Vite Integration using the 11ty Vite plugin (coming soon)
 [ ] Modern CSS build using LigthningCSS (coming soon)

Feel free to clone, fork or open a pull request to make this starter even greater.  
See you all in the stars!
